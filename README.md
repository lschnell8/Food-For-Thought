## Abstract 

This was a 5 day long Turing School of Software and Design Module 3 final solo project.  You can find the original project specs [HERE](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/showcase.html). This web app allows for users to navigate through recipes from a fetched API. The app presents users with an extensive list of Mediterranean recipes. My inspiration for this project was to provide heart healthy recipes to a loved one. I hope to expand on this project in the future to provide more prescribed diet plans. Along with this UI repo, a custom API was built to provide data [Mediterranean-Recipes-API](https://github.com/lschnell8/Mediterranean-Recipes-API.git)
